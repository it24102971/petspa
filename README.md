# 🌍 Tourism Management Mobile App

A premium full-stack mobile application built using the MERN stack with Expo (React Native). This platform allows users to explore tourist destinations, book tours, and manage travel-related services with ease.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

The project is organized into two main directories for a clean separation of concerns:

```text

│   ├── src/            # Backend source code
│   ├── .env            # Environment variables
│   └── server.js       # Entry point

└── frontend/           # Expo (React Native) Mobile Application
    ├── app/            # Screens (Expo Router)
    ├── components/     # Reusable UI components
    ├── constants/      # Design system (Colors, Spacing)

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Network**: Ensure your phone and computer are on the same WiFi network to use Expo Go.
- **Environment**: Never share your `.env` file or commit it to version control.
- **Localhost**: When connecting the frontend to the backend, use your computer's **Local IP Address** (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) instead of `localhost`.
